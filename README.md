# Fully Implemented RISC-V CPU
This is a continuation of my Lab 4- Reduced RISC-V CPU, where I attempt to implement a full CPU instruction set. In brief, I have several main goals:
1. To implement a single-cycle RV32I instruction set in a microarchitecture
2.  implement the F1 starting light algorithm in RV32I assembly language. I can do this but it's not possible to physically test it, so I'll find another way to implement it.
3. Pipeline version - With hazard detection and mitigation
4. Add set-associative data cache to the pipelined RV32I
5. If Possbile, complete the RV32I processor

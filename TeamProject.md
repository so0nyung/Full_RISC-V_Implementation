# Complete RISC-V Architecture
This repository contains a fully simulated RISC-V CPU that I wrote based on the Instructional Architecture & Compiler (IAC) module project written by Peter Cheung when he was a lecturer in the Imperial College London EEE Department. (See current version of the repo here)

## Brief
Reading the original brief [here](TeamProject.md). This is a continuation of the Lab 4 project that was a simplified RISC-V CPU, where I'm implementing more instructions.

The original prompt was supposed to write code to test the VBuddy to run the F1 light signal. I'll simulate this with different registers and (hopefully) show a sufficiently detailed .vcd diagram to show case the F1 lights working
